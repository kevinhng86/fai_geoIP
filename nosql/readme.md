This is the nosql version of the fai_geoIP API framework, you do not need any extra software or database server to operate this version.

This program is very powerful at speed. It can execute a query with in miliseconds and does not requires any database. Without reloading the ip array, the program was tested to completed 100,000 execution within 5 seconds.
